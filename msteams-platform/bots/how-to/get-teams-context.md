# Get Team's specific context for your bot

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](~/includes/v4-to-v3-pointer-bots.md)]

A bot can access additional context data about a team or chat it is installed in. This information can be used to enrich the bot's functionality and provide a more personalized experience.

## Fetching the roster or user profile

Your bot can query for the list of members and their basic profiles, including Teams user IDs and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) information such as name and objectId. You can use this information to correlate user identities, e.g., to check whether a user, logged into a tab through Azure AD credentials, is a member of the team. You can also use this call in a one-to-one chat to gain additional information about your user.

# [C#/.NET](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
public class MyBot : TeamsActivityHandler
{
    protected override async Task OnMessageActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IMessageActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        IEnumerable<TeamsChannelAccount> members = await TeamsInfo.GetMembersAsync(turnContext, cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

# [TypeScript/Node.js](#tab/typescript)

```typescript
export class MyBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
    constructor() {
        super();

        // See https://aka.ms/about-bot-activity-message to learn more about the message and other activity types.
        this.onMessage(async (turnContext, next) => {
            const members = await TeamsInfo.getMembers(turnContext);

            // By calling next() you ensure that the next BotHandler is run.
            await next();
        });
    }
}
```

# [JSON](#tab/json)
You can directly issue a GET request on `/v3/conversations/{teamId}/members/`, using the value of `serviceUrl` as the endpoint. The value of `serviceUrl` tends to be stable but can change. When a new message arrives, your bot should verify its stored value for `serviceUrl`.

```http
GET /v3/conversations/19:ja0cu120i1jod12j@skype.net/members

Response body

## Get team's details

When installed in a team, your bot can query for metadata about that team including the Azure AD groupId.

# [C#/.NET](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
public class MyBot : TeamsActivityHandler
{
    protected override async Task OnMessageActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IMessageActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        TeamDetails teamDetails = await TeamsInfo.GetTeamDetailsAsync(turnContext, turnContext.Activity.TeamsGetTeamInfo().Id, cancellationToken);
        if (teamDetails != null) {
            await turnContext.SendActivityAsync($"The groupId is: {teamDetails.AadGroupId}");
        }
        else {
            await turnContext.SendActivityAsync($"Message did not come from a channel in a team.");
        }
    }
}
```

# [TypeScript/Node.js](#tab/typescript)

```typescript
export class MyBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
    constructor() {
        super();

        // See https://aka.ms/about-bot-activity-message to learn more about the message and other activity types.
        this.onMessage(async (turnContext, next) => {
            const teamDetails = await TeamsInfo.getTeamDetails(turnContext);
            if (teamDetails) {
                await turnContext.sendActivity(`The group ID is: ${teamDetails.aadGroupId}`);
            } else {
                await turnContext.sendActivity('This message did not come from a channel in a team.');
            }

            // By calling next() you ensure that the next BotHandler is run.
            await next();
        });
    }
}
```

# [JSON](#tab/json)

You can directly issue a GET request on `/v3/teams/{teamId}`, using the value of `serviceUrl` as the endpoint. The value of `serviceUrl` tends to be stable but can change. When a new message arrives, your bot should verify its stored value for `serviceUrl`.

```http

    "name": "The Team Name",
    "aadGroupId": "02ce3874-dd86-41ba-bddc-013f34019978"
}
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
async def _show_details(self, turn_context: TurnContext):
	team_details = await TeamsInfo.get_team_details(turn_context)
	reply = MessageFactory.text(f"The team name is {team_details.name}. The team ID is {team_details.id}. The AADGroupID is {team_details.aad_group_id}.")
	await turn_context.send_activity(reply)
```

## Get the list of channels in a team

Your bot can query the list of channels in a team.

> [!NOTE]
>
>* The name of the default General channel is returned as `null` to allow for localization.
>* The channel ID for the General channel always matches the team ID.

# [C#/.NET](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
public class MyBot : TeamsActivityHandler
{
    protected override async Task OnMessageActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IMessageActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        IEnumerable<ChannelInfo> channels = await TeamsInfo.GetTeamChannelsAsync(turnContext, turnContext.Activity.TeamsGetTeamInfo().Id, cancellationToken);

        await turnContext.SendActivityAsync($"The channel count is: {channels.Count()}");
    }
}
```

# [TypeScript/Node.js](#tab/typescript)

```typescript
export class MyBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
    constructor() {
        super();

        // See https://aka.ms/about-bot-activity-message to learn more about the message and other activity types.
        this.onMessage(async (turnContext, next) => {
            const channels = await TeamsInfo.getTeamChannels(turnContext);

            await turnContext.sendActivity(`The channel count is: ${channels.length}`);

            // By calling next() you ensure that the next BotHandler is run.
            await next();
        });
    }
}
```

# [JSON](#tab/json)

You can directly issue a GET request on `/v3/teams/{teamId}/conversations`, using the value of `serviceUrl` as the endpoint. The value of `serviceUrl` tends to be stable but can change. When a new message arrives, your bot should verify its stored value for `serviceUrl`.

```http
GET /v3/teams/19%3A033451497ea84fcc83d17ed7fb08a1b6%40thread.skype/conversations

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
async def _show_channels(

    channels = await TeamsInfo.get_team_channels(turn_context)
    reply = MessageFactory.text(f"Total of {len(channels)} channels are currently in team")
    await turn_context.send_activity(reply)
