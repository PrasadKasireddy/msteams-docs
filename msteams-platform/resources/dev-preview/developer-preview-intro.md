# Public developer preview for Microsoft Teams

>[!NOTE]
>Features included in preview may not be complete, and may undergo changes before becoming available in the public release. They are provided for testing and exploration purposes only. They should not be used in production applications.

Developer Preview is a public program for developers which provides early access to unreleased features in Microsoft Teams. This allows you to explore and test upcoming features for potential inclusion in your Microsoft Teams app. We also welcome [feedback](~/feedback.md) on any feature in developer preview. Developer preview is enabled per Microsoft Teams client, so you don't need to worry about affecting your entire organization.

## Developer preview app manifest

Many features enabled in developer preview will require alterations to your app manifest JSON file. To do so you'll need to use the [developer preview manifest schema](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema-dev-preview.md) If you use this schema, you will not be able to use [App Studio](~/concepts/build-and-test/app-studio-overview.md) to make these changes, nor will you be able to use it to upload your app for testing. To upload your app you'll need to click the `More apps` icon on the app bar, then select the `Upload a custom app link`. Using this method you can only upload a zipped version of your app package.

You may find it useful to use App Studio to create the non-developer preview portions of your app package, then export that package and manually edit the `manifest.json` file to add the developer preview features you wish to use. Once you've added developer preview features to the `manifest.json` file you will not be able to re-import the package into App Studio.

## Enable developer preview

Developer preview is enabled on a per-client basis, but the option to turn on developer preview is controlled at the organization level. To enable the option to turn on developer preview for an individual, you must ensure that they have the ability to upload custom apps. See [setting up your tenant](~/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md) for additional information.

Using an app that contains developer preview features may cause clients that have not enabled developer preview to behave unexpectedly. If you do not see an entry for developer preview the most likely reason is your organization is not configured for app uploading.
