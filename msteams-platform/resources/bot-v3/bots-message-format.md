# Message formatting for bots

[!include[v3-to-v4-SDK-pointer](~/includes/v3-to-v4-pointer-bots.md)]

You can set the optional [`TextFormat`](/bot-framework/dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-create-messages#customizing-a-message) property to control how your message's text content is rendered.

Microsoft Teams supports the following formatting options:

| TextFormat value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| plain | The text should be treated as raw text with no formatting applied at all |
| markdown | The text should be treated as Markdown formatting and rendered on the channel as appropriate; see [Formatting text content](#formatting-text-content) for supported styles |
| xml | The text is simple XML markup; see [Formatting text content](#formatting-text-content) for supported styles |

## Formatting text content

Microsoft Teams supports a subset of Markdown and XML (HTML) formatting tags.

Currently, the following limitations apply:

* Text-only messages do not support table formatting
* Rich cards support formatting in the text property only, not in the title or subtitle properties
* Rich cards do not support Markdown or table formatting

## Cross-platform support

To ensure that your formatting works across all platforms supported by Microsoft Teams, be aware that some styles are not currently supported across all platforms.
