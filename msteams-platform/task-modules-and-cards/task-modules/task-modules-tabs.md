# Using task modules in tabs

Adding a task module to your tab can greatly simplify your user's experience for any workflows that require data input. Task modules allow you to gather their input in a Teams-aware popup. A good example of this is editing Planner cards; you can use task modules to create a similar experience.

To support the task module feature, two new functions were added to the [Microsoft Teams client SDK](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client):

```typescript
microsoftTeams.tasks.startTask(
    taskInfo: TaskInfo,
    submitHandler?: (err: string, result: string | any) => void
): void;

microsoftTeams.tasks.submitTask(
    result?: string | any,
    appIds?: string | string[]
): void;
```

Let's see how each of them work.

## Invoking a task module from a tab

To invoke a task module from a tab use `microsoftTeams.tasks.startTask()` passing a [TaskInfo object](~/task-modules-and-cards/what-are-task-modules.md#the-taskinfo-object) and an optional `submitHandler` callback function. As described earlier, there are two cases to consider:

1. The value of `TaskInfo.url` is set to a URL. The task module window appears and `TaskModule.url` is loaded as an `<iframe>` inside it. JavaScript on that page should call `microsoftTeams.initialize()`. If there is a `submitHandler` function on the page and there is an error when invoking `microsoftTeams.tasks.startTask()`, then `submitHandler` is invoked with `err` set to the error string indicating the error as described [below](#task-module-invocation-errors).
1. The value of `taskInfo.card` is the [JSON for an Adaptive card](~/task-modules-and-cards/what-are-task-modules.md#adaptive-card-or-adaptive-card-bot-card-attachment). In this case there's obviously not any JavaScript `submitHandler` function to call when the user closes or presses a button on the Adaptive card; the only way to receive what the user entered is by passing the result to a bot. To use an Adaptive card task module from a tab your app must include a bot to get any information back from the user. This is explained below.

## Example: Invoking a task module

The code below is adapted from [the task module sample](~/task-modules-and-cards/what-are-task-modules.md#task-module-samples). Here's what the task module looks like:

![Task Module - Custom Form](~/assets/images/task-module/task-module-custom-form.png)

The `submitHandler` is very simple; it just echoes the value of `err` or `result` to the console:

```javascript
let taskInfo = {
    title: null,
    height: null,
    width: null,
    url: null,
    card: null,
    fallbackUrl: null,
    completionBotId: null,
};

taskInfo.url = "https://contoso.com/teamsapp/customform";
taskInfo.title = "Custom Form";
taskInfo.height = 510;
taskInfo.width = 430;
submitHandler = (err, result) => {
    console.log(`Submit handler - err: ${err}`);
    console.log(`Submit handler - result\rName: ${result.name}\rEmail: ${result.email}\rFavorite book: ${result.favoriteBook}`);
};
microsoftTeams.tasks.startTask(taskInfo, submitHandler);
```

## Submitting the result of a task module

The `submitHandler` function is used with `TaskInfo.url`. The `submitHandler` function resides in the `TaskInfo.url` web page. If there's an error when invoking the task module your `submitHandler` function will be immediately invoked with an `err` string indicating which [error occurred](#task-module-invocation-errors). The `submitHandler` function is also called with an `err` string when the user presses the X at the upper right of task module.

If there's no invocation error and the user doesn't press X to dismiss it, the user presses a button when finished. Depending on whether it's a URL or an Adaptive card in the task module, here's what happens:

### HTML/JavaScript (`TaskInfo.url`)

Once you've validated what the user has entered you call the `microsoftTeams.tasks.submitTask()` SDK function (referred to hereafter as `submitTask()` for readability purposes). You can call `submitTask()` without any parameters if you just want Teams to close the task module, but most of the time you'll want to pass an object or a string to your `submitHandler`.

Pass your result as the first parameter. Teams will invoke `submitHandler` where `err` will be `null` and `result` will be the object/string you passed to `submitTask()`. If you do call `submitTask()` with a `result` parameter, you **must** pass an `appId` or an array of `appId` strings: this allows Teams to validate that the app sending the result is the same one which invoked the task module.

### Adaptive card (`TaskInfo.card`)

If you invoked the task module with a `submitHandler`, when the user presses an `Action.Submit` button the values in the card will be returned as the value of `result`. If the user presses the Esc button or presses the X, `err` will be returned instead. Alternatively, if your app contains a bot in addition to a tab you can simply include the `appId` of the bot as the value of `completionBotId` in the `TaskInfo` object. The Adaptive card body (as filled in by the user) will be sent to the bot via a `task/submit invoke` message when the user presses an `Action.Submit` button. The schema for the object you receive is very similar to [the schema you receive for task/fetch and task/submit messages](~/task-modules-and-cards/task-modules/task-modules-bots.md#payload-of-taskfetch-and-tasksubmit-messages); the only difference is that the schema of the JSON object is an Adaptive card object as opposed to an object *containing* an Adaptive card object as [when Adaptive cards are used with bots](~/task-modules-and-cards/task-modules/task-modules-bots.md#payload-of-taskfetch-and-tasksubmit-messages).

## Example: submitting the result of a task module

Recall the [form in the task module above](#example-invoking-a-task-module) with an HTML form. Here's where the form is defined:

```html
<form method="POST" id="customerForm" action="/register" onSubmit="return validateForm()">
```

There are five fields on this form but we're only interested in the values of three of them for this example: `name`, `email`, and `favoriteBook`.

Here's the `validateForm()` function that calls `submitTask()`:

```javascript
function validateForm() {
    var customerInfo = {
        name: document.forms["customerForm"]["name"].value,
        email: document.forms["customerForm"]["email"].value,
        favoriteBook: document.forms["customerForm"]["favoriteBook"].value
    }
    microsoftTeams.tasks.submitTask(customerInfo, "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx");
    return true;
}
```

## Task module invocation errors

Here are the possible values of `err` that can be received by your `submitHandler`:

| Problem | Error message (value of `err`) |
| ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Values for both `TaskInfo.url` and `TaskInfo.card` were specified. | "Values for both card and url were specified. One or the other, but not both, are allowed." |
| Neither `TaskInfo.url` nor `TaskInfo.card` specified. | "You must specify a value for either card or url." |
| Invalid `appId`. | "Invalid appId." |
| User pressed X button, closing it. | "User cancelled/closed the task module." |
