# Cards Reference

The cards listed in this section are supported in bots for Teams. They are based on cards defined by the Bot Framework, but Teams does not support all Bot Framework cards and has added some of its own. Differences are called out in the references below.

## Card examples

You can find additional information on how to use cards in the documentation for the Bot Builder SDK (v3). There are also code samples available in the Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples repository on GitHub.

## Types of cards

This table shows the types of cards available to you.

| Card Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Adaptive Card](#adaptive-card) | Highly customizable card that can contain any combination of text, speech, images, buttons and input fields. |
| [Hero Card](#hero-card) | Typically contains a single large image, one or more buttons, and a small amount of text. |
| [List Card](#list-card) | A scrolling list of items. |
| [Office 365 Connector Card](#office-365-connector-card) | Flexible layout with multiple sections, fields, images and actions. |
| [Receipt Card](#receipt-card) | Provides a receipt to the user. |
| [Signin Card](#signin-card) | Enables a bot to request that a user sign in. |
| [Thumbnail Card](#thumbnail-card) | Typically contains a single thumbnail image, some short text, and one or more buttons. |
| [Card Collections](#card-collections) | Used to return multiple items in a single response |

## Common properties for all cards

### Inline card images

Your card can contain an inline image by including a link to your publicly available image. For performance purposes we highly recommend you host your image on a public content-delivery network (CDN).

Images are scaled up or down in size while maintaining the aspect ratio to cover the image area, and then cropped from center to achieve the appropriate aspect ratio for the card.

Images must be at most 1024×1024 and 1 MB in PNG, JPEG, or GIF format; animated GIF is not officially supported.

| Property | Type  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| url | URL | HTTPS URL to the image |
| alt | String | Accessible description of the image |

### Buttons

Buttons are shown stacked at the bottom of the card. Button text is always on a single line and will be truncated if the text exceeds the button width. Any additional buttons beyond the maximum number supported by the card will not be shown.

See [Card Actions](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-actions.md) for more information.

### Card Formatting

See [Card Formatting](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format.md) for more information on text formatting in cards.

## Adaptive card

> [!NOTE]
> Only version 1.0 of Adaptive Cards is supported for all users. Version 1.2 is currently available only in Developer Preview

A customizable card that can contain any combination of text, speech, images, buttons, and input fields.

## Office 365 connector card

Supported in Teams, not in Bot Framework.

The Office 365 Connector card provides a flexible layout with multiple sections, fields, images, and actions. This card encapsulates a connector card so that it can be used by bots. See the notes section for differences between connector cards and the O365 card.

### Support for Office 365 connector cards

| Bots in Teams | Messaging Extensions  | Connectors | Bot Framework |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✖ |
|

### Properties of the Office 365 connector card

| Property | Type  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| title | Rich text | Title of the card. Maximum 2 lines; formatting not currently supported |
| summary | Rich text | Summary of the card. Maximum 2 lines; formatting not currently supported |
| text | Rich text | Text appears just below the subtitle; see [Card formatting](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format.md) for formatting options |
| themeColor | HEX string | color that overrides the accentColor provided from the application manifest |

### Notes on the Office 365 connector card

Office 365 Connector cards function properly on Microsoft Teams, including [ActionCard actions](/outlook/actionable-messages/card-reference#actioncard-action).

One important difference between using Connector cards from a Connector and using Connector cards in your bot is the handling of card actions.

* For a Connector, the endpoint receives the card payload via HTTP POST.
* For a bot, the `HttpPOST` action triggers an `invoke` activity that sends only the action ID and body to the bot.

Each Connector card can display a maximum of 10 sections, and each section can contain a maximum of 5 images and 5 actions.

> [!NOTE]
> Any additional sections, images, or actions in a message will not appear.

All text fields support Markdown and HTML. You can control which sections use Markdown or HTML by setting the `markdown` property in a message. By default, `markdown` is set to `true`; if you want to use HTML instead, set `markdown` to `false`.

If you specify the `themeColor` property, it overrides the `accentColor` property in the app manifest.

To specify the rendering style for `activityImage`, you can set `activityImageType` as follows.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `avatar` | Default; `activityImage` will be cropped as a circle |
| `article` | `activityImage` will be displayed as a rectangle and retain its aspect ratio |

For all other details about Connector card properties, see the [Actionable message card reference](/outlook/actionable-messages/card-reference). The only Connector card properties that Microsoft Teams does not currently support are as follows:

* `heroImage`
* `hideOriginalBody`
* `startGroup` (always treated as `true` in Teams)
* `originator`
* `correlationId`

## Receipt card

Supported in Teams.

A card that enables a bot to provide a receipt to the user. It typically contains the list of items to include on the receipt, tax and total information, and other text.

## Signin card

A card that enables a bot to request that a user sign in. Supported in Teams in a slightly different form than is found in the Bot Framework. The signin card in Teams is similar to the signin card in the bot framework with the exception that the signin card in Teams only supports two actions: `signin` and `openUrl`.

The *signin action* can be used from any card in Teams, not just the signin card. See the topic [Microsoft Teams authentication flow for bots](~/bots/how-to/authentication/auth-flow-bot.md) for more details on authentication.
