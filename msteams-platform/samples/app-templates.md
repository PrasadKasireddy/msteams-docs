# App Templates for Microsoft Teams

App templates are production-ready apps for Microsoft Teams that are community driven, open-source, and available on GitHub. Each contains detailed instructions for deploying and installing that app for your organization, providing a ready-to-use app that you can install and begin using immediately. The complete source code is available as well, so you can explore it in detail, or fork the code and alter it to meet your specific needs.

## Key benefits of using app templates

* **Plug and play experience:** All app templates include deployments scripts that will allow you to host all necessary services in Microsoft Azure. No coding is required to deploy the apps.
* **Production-ready code:** The app templates conform to recommended best practices around security and infrastructure, and all community submitted changes to them are reviewed to ensure continued conformance.
* **Customizable and extensible:** While all app templates are ready to deploy as they are, we provide the entire code base and deployment scripts so that you can easily customize or extend them to fit your unique needs.
* **Detailed documentation & support:** All app templates are accompanied by end-to-end documentation on solution architecture, deployment, and configuration steps. The repositories are monitored as well, so please report any issues you encounter by raising an Issue on GitHub.

## List Search

Collaboration in Microsoft Teams quite often references information contained within items in a SharePoint list. Simply pasting a link to the item in question forces everyone to switch context away from the conversation, find the needed information, then return to Teams to continue the conversation. As the conversation continues typically people will have to switch back to the reference item multiple times to verify new comments and refresh their memories of the information contained within the item. This context switching creates a barrier to smooth collaboration, and is a recipe for things falling through the cracks.

To help alleviate this pain, we are happy to bring to you the List Search app template. Millions of users use SharePoint to power some of the core workflows in their organizations. However, collaborating around lists can be especially tedious. Using the List Search app template in Microsoft Teams, users can insert information from SharePoint list items directly within a chat conversation to alleviate the context-switching caused when simply inserting a link into a chat. The information is inserted as an easy-to-read auto-formatted card, helping your users stay engaged in the conversation.

For example, product teams can easily share product images and GIFs to social media, marketing and sales teams programmatically. One can also extend this app by triggering a notification flow to specific teams/individuals when new images/GIFs are made available.
