# Link unfurling

[!include[v4-to-v3-SDK-pointer](~/includes/v4-to-v3-pointer-me.md)]

With link unfurling your app can register to receive an `invoke` activity when URLs with a particular domain are pasted into the compose message area. The `invoke` will contain the full URL that was pasted into the compose message area, and you can respond with a card the user can *unfurl*, providing additional information or actions. This works very similarly to a [search command](~/messaging-extensions/how-to/search-commands/define-search-command.md), with the URL serving as the search term.

The Azure DevOps messaging extension uses link unfurling to look for URLs pasted into the compose message area pointing to a work item. In the screenshot below, a user has pasted in a URL for a work item in Azure DevOps which the messaging extension has resolved into a card.

## Add link unfurling to your app manifest

To do this you'll add a new `messageHandlers` array to the `composeExtensions` section of your app manifest JSON. You can either do so with the help of App Studio, or manually. Domain listings can include wildcards, for example `*.example.com`. This matches exactly one segment of the domain; if you need to match `a.b.example.com` then use `*.*.example.com`.

### Using App Studio

1. In App Studio, on the Manifest editor tab, load your app manifest.
1. On the **Messaging Extension** page, add the domain you want to look for in the **Message handlers** section as in the screenshot below.

### Manually

To enable your messaging extension to interact with links this way you'll first need to add the `messageHandlers` array to your app manifest as in the example below. This example is not the complete manifest, see [manifest reference](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md) for a complete manifest example.

```json
...
"composeExtensions": [
  {
    "botId": "abc123456-ab12-ab12-ab12-abcdef123456",
    "messageHandlers": [
      {
        "type": "link",
        "value": {
          "domains": [
            "*.trackeddomain.com"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
],
...
```

## Handle the `composeExtension/queryLink` invoke

Once you've added the domain to listen on to the app manifest, you'll need to update your web service code to handle the invoke request. Use the URL you receive to search your service and create a card response. If you respond with more than one card, only the first will be used.

We support the following card types:

* [Thumbnail card](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-reference.md#thumbnail-card)
* [Hero card](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-reference.md#hero-card)
* [Office 365 Connector card](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-reference.md#office-365-connector-card)
* [Adaptive Card](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-reference.md#adaptive-card)

See [What are cards](~/task-modules-and-cards/what-are-cards.md) for an overview.

# [C#/.NET](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
protected override async Task<MessagingExtensionResponse> OnTeamsAppBasedLinkQueryAsync(ITurnContext<IInvokeActivity> turnContext, AppBasedLinkQuery query, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    //You'll use the query.link value to search your service and create a card response
    var heroCard = new ThumbnailCard
    {
        Title = "Thumbnail Card",
        Text = query.Url,
        Images = new List<CardImage> { new CardImage("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk/master/icon.png") },
    };

    var attachments = new MessagingExtensionAttachment(HeroCard.ContentType, null, heroCard);
    var result = new MessagingExtensionResult(AttachmentLayoutTypes.List, "result", new[] { attachments }, null, "test unfurl");

    return new MessagingExtensionResponse(result);
}
```

# [JavaScript/Node.js](#tab/javascript)

```javascript
class TeamsLinkUnfurlingBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
  handleTeamsAppBasedLinkQuery(context, query) {
    const attachment = CardFactory.thumbnailCard('Thumbnail Card',
      query.url,
      ['https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk/master/icon.png']);

    const result = {
      attachmentLayout: 'list',
      type: 'result',
      attachments: [attachment]
    };

    const response = {
      composeExtension: result
    };
    return response;
  }
}
```

# [JSON](#tab/json)

This is an example of the `invoke` sent to your bot.

```json
{
  "type": "invoke",
  "name": "composeExtension/queryLink",
  "value": {
    "url": "https://theurlsubmittedbyyouruser.trackeddomain.com/id/1234"
  }
}
```

An example of the response is shown below.

```json
{
  "composeExtension": {
    "type": "result",
    "attachmentLayout": "list",
    "attachments": [
      {
        "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.teams.card.o365connector",
        "content": {
          "sections": [
            {
              "activityTitle": "[85069]: Create a cool app",
              "activityImage": "https://placekitten.com/200/200"
            },
            {
              "title": "Details",
              "facts": [
                {
                  "name": "Assigned to:",
                  "value": "[Larry Brown](mailto:larryb@example.com)"
                },
                {
                  "name": "State:",
                  "value": "Active"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
