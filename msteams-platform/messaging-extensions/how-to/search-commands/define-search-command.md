# Define messaging extension search commands

[!include[v4-to-v3-SDK-pointer](~/includes/v4-to-v3-pointer-me.md)]

Messaging extension search commands allow your users to search external systems and insert the results of that search into a message in the form of a card.

## Choose messaging extension invoke locations

The first thing you need to decide is where your search command can be triggered (or more specifically, *invoked*) from. Your search command can be invoked from one or both of the following locations:

* The buttons at the bottom of the compose message area
* By @mentioning in the command box

When invoked from the compose message area, your user will have the option of sending the results to the conversation. When invoked from the command box, the user can interact with the resulting card, or copy it for use elsewhere.

## Add the command to your app manifest

Now that you've decided how users will interact with your search command, it is time to add it to your app manifest. To do this you'll add a new `composeExtension` object to the top level of your app manifest JSON. You can either do so with the help of App Studio, or manually.

### Create a command using App Studio

The following steps assume you've already [created a messaging extension](~/messaging-extensions/how-to/create-messaging-extension.md).

1. From the Microsoft Teams client, open **App Studio** and select the **Manifest Editor** tab.
2. If you've already created your app package in App Studio, chose it from the list. If not, you can import an existing app package.
3. Click the **Add** button in the Command section.
4. Choose **Allow users to query your service for information and insert that into a message**.
5. Add a **Command Id** and a **Title**.
6. Select where you want your search command to be triggered from. Selecting **message** does not currently alter the behavior of your search command.
7. Add your search parameter.
8. Click Save.

### Manually create a command

To manually add your messaging extension search command to your app manifest, you'll need to add the follow parameters to your `composeExtension.commands` array of objects.

| Property name | Purpose | Required? | Minimum manifest version |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | Unique ID that you assign to this command. The user request will include this ID. | Yes | 1.0 |
| `title` | Command name. This value appears in the UI. | Yes | 1.0 |
| `description` | Help text indicating what this command does. This value appears in the UI. | Yes | 1.0 |
| `type` | Must be `query` | No | 1.4 |
|`initialRun` | If set to **true**, indicates this command should be executed as soon as the user chooses this command in the UI. | No | 1.0 |
| `context` | Optional array of values that defines the context the search action is available in. Possible values are `message`, `compose`, or `commandBox`. Default is `["compose", "commandBox"]`. | No | 1.5 |

You'll also need to add the details of the search parameter, which will define the text visible to your user in the Teams client.

| Property name | Purpose | Required? | Minimum manifest version |
|---|---|---|---|
| `parameters` | Static list of parameters for the command. | No | 1.0 |
| `parameter.name` | The name of the parameter. This is sent to your service in the user request. | Yes | 1.0 |
| `parameter.description` | Describes this parameterâ€™s purposes or example of the value that should be provided. This value appears in the UI. | Yes | 1.0 |
| `parameter.title` | Short user-friendly parameter title or label. | Yes | 1.0 |
| `parameter.inputType` | Set to the type of input required. Possible values include `text`, `textarea`, `number`, `date`, `time`, `toggle`. Default is set to `text` | No | 1.4 |

#### App manifest example

The below is an example of a `composeExtensions` object defining a search command. It is not an example of the complete manifest, for the full app manifest schema see: [App manifest schema](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md).

```json
{
...
  "composeExtensions": [
    {
      "botId": "57a3c29f-1fc5-4d97-a142-35bb662b7b23",
      "canUpdateConfiguration": true,
      "commands": [{
          "id": "searchCmd",
          "description": "Search Bing for information on the web",
          "title": "Search",
          "initialRun": true,
          "parameters": [{
            "name": "searchKeyword",
            "description": "Enter your search keywords",
            "title": "Keywords"
          }]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
...
}
```

## Next steps

Now that you've added your search command, you'll need to [handle the search request](~/messaging-extensions/how-to/search-commands/respond-to-search.md).
