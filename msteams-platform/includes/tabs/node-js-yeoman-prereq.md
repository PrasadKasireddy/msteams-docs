## Prerequisites

- To complete this quickstart you will need an Office 365 tenant and a team configured with *Allow uploading custom apps* enabled. To learn more, see [Prepare your Office 365 tenant](~/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md).

  - If you don't currently have an Office 365 account, you can sign up for a free subscription through the Office 365 Developer Program. The subscription will remain active as long as you're using it for ongoing development. See [Welcome to the Office 365 Developer Program](/OfficeDev/office-dev-program-docs/docs/office-365-developer-program.md).

In addition, this project requires that you have the following installed in your development environment:

- Any text editor or IDE. You can install and use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for free.

- [Node.js/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/). You should use the latest LTS version. The Node Package Manager (npm) will install into your system with the installation of Node.js.

- After you've successfully installed Node.js, install the [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) and [gulp-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli) packages by typing the following in your command prompt:

```bash
npm install yo gulp-cli --global
```

- Install the Microsoft Teams Apps generator by typing the following in your command prompt:

```bash
npm install generator-teams --global
```

## Generate your project

- To start the generator, navigate to your new directory and type the following command:

```bash
yo teams
```

- Next, you'll provide a series of values that will be used in your application's **manifest.json** file:
