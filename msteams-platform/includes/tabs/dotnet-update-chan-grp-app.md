### _Layout.cshtml

For your tab to display in Teams, you must include the **Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK** and include a call to `microsoftTeams.initialize()` after your page loads. This is how your tab and the Teams client communicate:

- Navigate to the **Shared** folder, open **_Layout.cshtml**, and add the following to the `<head>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/sdk/v1.6.0/js/MicrosoftTeams.min.js"></script>
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Don't copy/paste the `<script src="...">` URLs from this page, as they may not represent the latest version. To get the latest version of the SDK, always go to: [Microsoft Teams JavaScript API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teams-js.com).

### Tab.cshtml

Open **Tab.cshtml** and update the embedded `<script>` as follows:

- At the top of the script, call `microsoftTeams.initialize()`.

- Update the `websiteUrl` and `contentUrl` values in each function with the HTTPS ngrok URL to your tab.

Your code should now look like the following with **y8rCgT2b** replaced with your ngrok URL:

```javascript
    microsoftTeams.initialize();

    let saveGray = () => {
        microsoftTeams.settings.registerOnSaveHandler(function (saveEvent) {
            microsoftTeams.settings.setSettings({
                websiteUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io`,
                contentUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io/gray/`,
                entityId: "grayIconTab",
                suggestedDisplayName: "MyNewTab"
            });
            saveEvent.notifySuccess();
        });
    }

    let saveRed = () => {
        microsoftTeams.settings.registerOnSaveHandler(function (saveEvent) {
            microsoftTeams.settings.setSettings({
                websiteUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io`,
                contentUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io/red/`,
                entityId: "redIconTab",
                suggestedDisplayName: "MyNewTab"
            });
            saveEvent.notifySuccess();
        });
    }
```

Make sure to save the updated **Tab.cshtml**.

## Build and run your application

- In Visual Studio press **F5**, or choose **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu. Verify that **ngrok** is running and working properly by opening your browser and going to your content page via the ngrok HTTPS URL that was provided in your command prompt window.

>[!TIP]
>You need to have both your application in Visual Studio and ngrok running to complete this quickstart. If you need to stop running your application in Visual Studio to work on it **keep ngrok running**. It will continue to listen and will resume routing your application's request when it restarts in Visual Studio. If you have to restart the ngrok service it will return a new URL and you'll have to update your application with the new URL.

## Upload your tab to Teams with App Studio

>[!Note]
> We use App Studio to edit your **manifest.json** file and upload the completed package to Teams. You can also manually edit the **manifest.json** file if you prefer. If you do, be sure to build the solution again to create the **tab.zip** file to upload.

- Open the Microsoft Teams client. If you use the [web based version](https://teams.microsoft.com) you can inspect your front-end code using your browser's [developer tools](~/tabs/how-to/developer-tools.md).

- Open App studio and select the **Manifest editor** tab.

- Select the **Import an existing app** tile in the Manifest editor to begin updating the app package for your tab. The source code comes with its own partially complete manifest. The name of your app package is **tab.zip**. It should be found here:

```bash
/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.2/tab.zip
```

- Upload **tab.zip** to App Studio.

### Update your app package with Manifest editor

Once you've uploaded your app package into App Studio, you'll need to finish configuring it.

- Select the tile for your newly imported tab in the right panel of the Manifest editor welcome page.

There's a list of steps in the left-hand side of the Manifest editor, and on the right, a list of properties that need to have values for each of those steps. Much of the information has been provided by your *manifest.json* but there are a few fields that you'll need to update:

#### Details: App details

- Under *Identification* select ***Generate*** to replace the placeholder id with the required GUID for your tab.

- Under *Developer information* update the **Website URL** field with your *ngrok* HTTPS URL.

- Under *App URLs* update the **Privacy statement** and **Terms of use** URL fields with your *ngrok* HTTPS URL. Remember to include the */privacy* and */tou* paths at the end of the URLs.

#### Capabilities: Tabs

In the *Tabs* section:

- Under *Team Tab* select **Add**.

- In the Team tab pop-up window update the *Configuration URL* to `https://<yourngrokurl>/tab`.

- Finally, make sure the *can update configuration? Team*, and *Group chat* boxes are checked and select **Save**.

#### Finish: Domains and permissions

In the *Domains and permissions* section, the *Domains from your tabs* field should contain your ngrok URL without the HTTPS prefix - `<yourngrokurl>.ngrok.io/`.

#### Test and distribute: Test and distribute

>[!IMPORTANT]
>In the **Description** field on the right you'll see the following warning:
>
>&#9888; "**The 'validDomains' array cannot contain a tunneling site...**"
>
>This warning can be ignored while testing your tab.

In the *Test and distribute* section:

- Select **Install**.

- In the pop-up window's *Add to a team or chat* field enter your team and select **Install**.

- In the next pop-up window choose the team channel where you would like the tab displayed and select **Set up**.

- In the final pop-up window select a value for the tab page (either a red or gray icon) and select **Save**.

To view your tab, navigate to the team you installed it on, and select it from the tab bar. The page that you chose during configuration should be displayed.
