## Update your application

### _Layout.cshtml

For your tab to display in Teams, you must include the **Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK** and include a call to `microsoftTeams.initialize()` after your page loads. This is how your tab and the Teams app communicate:

- Navigate to the **Shared** folder, open **_Layout.cshtml**, and add the following to the `<head>` tags section:

```html
`<script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"></script>`
`<script src="https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/sdk/v1.6.0/js/MicrosoftTeams.min.js"></script>`
```

### PersonalTab.cshtml

Open **PersonalTab.cshtml** and update the embedded `<script>` tags by calling `microsoftTeams.initialize()`.

Make sure to save your updated *PersonalTab.cshtml*.
