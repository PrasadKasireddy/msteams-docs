# Distribute your Microsoft Teams app

Once you've created your app there are three options for distributing it:

1. [Upload your app directly](#upload-your-app-directly).
2. [Publish your app to your organization's app catalog](#publish-to-your-organizations-app-catalog).
3. [Publish your app through AppSource](#publish-to-appsource).

## Upload your app directly

This is the easiest way to test and use your app. If you are the team owner and/or [uploading custom apps is enabled](/microsoftteams/admin-settings), you can [directly upload (or sideload)](./apps-upload.md) the app and start using it right away. However, if you want to share the app with others, you'll have to send them your app package and ask them to upload it independently. 

If you want to distribute your app more broadly,Teams provides an in-app gallery for users to find or discover high-quality Teams apps. To have your solution available in the gallery, you must either [publish to your organization's app catalog](#publish-to-your-organizations-app-catalog) or [publish to AppSource](./appsource/publish.md) 

## Publish to your organization's app catalog

Your organization's app catalog contains apps unique to your organization and is completely under your organization's control. You can find more information in the article [*Publish apps to your organization's app catalog*](/microsoftteams/tenant-apps-catalog-teams). This feature can only be managed by Teams users with Microsoft Office 365 tenant admin privileges.

## Publish to AppSource

AppSource (formerly known as Office Store) provides a convenient location for you to distribute your Microsoft Teams app, as well as other Office 365 extensibility types such as Office add-ins and SharePoint add-ins. Follow our guidelines to [submit your app to AppSource](./appsource/publish.md).
