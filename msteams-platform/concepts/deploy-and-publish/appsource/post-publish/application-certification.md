# Microsoft Teams App Certification

The Microsoft Teams app certification program, is a pilot program that allows you to complete a voluntary self-assessment of your app's security, data handling and compliance practices. The information you provide will be processed and presented to your potential customers so they can better evaluate your app before enabling it for their organization. As part of the [app submission process](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-publish.md) you'll have the option to complete the assessment, which will then be compiled and presented to Microsoft Teams administrators.

## Program benefits

Once you've completed the assessment your responses will be compiled and a page for your app will be created on [this site](https://aka.ms/AppCertification). Instead of responding to requests for information individually, you'll be able to point your customers here for complete information on your app's data handling, security and compliance practices. Microsoft Teams administrators are encouraged to use this catalogue to discover new apps that will be easier for them to assess and onboard into their organizations.

## How to join the program

Completing app certification is voluntary, but highly encouraged. Just let us know you're interested and we'll guide you through the process.

### For existing store apps

If you already have an app in the app store and you'd like to join the program you can contact us by filling out [this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR3oKPRKv815GlRdzCCYPJGZUOUgzSUtFNU8yOFpYR0oyWElHVkxHODhQUyQlQCN0PWcu). Someone from our team will follow up with you to get the process started.

### For new or updated store apps

For newly submitted apps, or update submissions to existing apps, you'll be asked to participate during the approval process. While this is not required, and will not block the approval of your app, we highly suggest that you take the time to fill out the assessment.

### Information you'll need to provide

When you're completing the assessment, you'll need the following types of information.

#### General

Basic information about your app like licensing details and contact information.

#### Data Handling

Information about what data your app is collecting, why you're collecting that information, and if the administrator has any control over the collected information. Examples include data accessed through Microsoft Graph, any bot capabilities, and any telemetry you're collecting.

#### Security & Compliance

Information related to security and compliance of the entire app (not just your Teams app, but the underlying services as well). The information is stored in Microsoft Cloud App Security catalog. For more information see [this page](/cloud-app-security/attest-your-app).
