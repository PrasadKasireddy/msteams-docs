# Dialogs

Dialogs should be used sparingly since they can be disruptive, and should have a clear way for the user to exit.

---

## Sizes

We have 3 dialog sizes to choose from. Choose the size that is appropriate for the content you have.
[!include[Dialog sizes](~/includes/design/dialogs-image-sizes.html)]

---

## Buttons

Buttons are right-justified.
All other elements (checkboxes, help text, etc.) should be left-justified.
Don’t duplicate negative actions (Never provide an ‘X’ and a ‘Cancel’ button at the same time.).
‘Apply’ buttons should be paired with ‘Cancel’ buttons.
[!include[Dialog buttons](~/includes/design/dialogs-image-buttons.html)]

---

## Scrolling

In some cases, content will scroll. The dialog title and other important information remains in place.
[!include[Dialog scrolling](~/includes/design/dialogs-image-scrolling.html)]

---

## Padding

The padding around all four sides of the dialog should be 32px.
[!include[Dialog padding](~/includes/design/dialogs-image-padding.html)]

---

## Typography

We use Segoe UI SemiBold at 18pt (title2) and $app-black for dialog titles. For body text, we use Segoe UI Regular at 14pt (base) and $app-black.
