# Buttons, links, and controls

---

## Button types

The way buttons are styled helps communicate what kind of action they trigger. We maintain a wide range of buttons that are formatted to show different levels of emphasis.

Buttons can have text, an icon, or a combination of text and an icon. To communicate different levels in a hierarchy, we designed primary and secondary buttons within each category.

### Text buttons

In dialogs, you should align buttons to the right, starting with the primary action farthest to the right. In cards, buttons are left-aligned.

### Icon buttons

Icon buttons can invoke an action and can also be toggled on and off.

In some cases, you can pair an icon and text to increase emphasis.

## Style

## Size and padding

Text buttons, icons, and controls are contained within a 32px high container to ensure all controls are visually aligned and consistent.
[!include[Size and padding](~/includes/design/style-image-size.html)]

### Rounded corners

Text buttons have a corner radius of 3px.

### Button text

Use sentence case in text for buttons to help with localization and legibility. (In other words, only capitalize the first letter of the first word in a phrase or sentence.)
